# 关于这本书
关于版权问题，希望不要有侵权的事情发生在这里，不涉及商业买卖应该是可以使用的吧，暂且这样认为。

关于本书的制作缘由，是因为我在图书馆中看到这本书觉得很好看，很想让家里的妹妹也看到，但是网上只能找到英文原版的pdf，妹妹的英语读起来还是有点吃力，虽然我还是觉得直接读英文的更能提高她的英语能力，所以就自己一张张扫描下来制成了pdf，特此分享在网上，让更多暂时不能获得实体书的小孩子看到这本治愈的书。

# About this scanning edition
_The little world of liz climo_ in Chinese language
About the copyright of this DIY scanning book, I do not want to be stuck in the dispute of torts. If there is no business transaction, I think, it will be legal to share this one with all net friends. Think of it this way for a moment. 

The reason of the birth of this sanning edition is that I wanted to share the print one with my little sister when I saw the book in the libray. But what I could find in the Internet was just the original English one which was difficult to my little sister. Even though it was better for her to improve the English reading skill I thought. I scaned the pages one by one to make a PDF edition. I hope this job could help the childs who have difficult in getting the print one.
